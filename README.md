Sundial datetime wrapper
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tidepool-org/sundial.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tidepool-org/sundial)


The tidepool platform stores timestamps as ISO8601 timestamp with a timezone.

The purposes of this library are:

* Wrap the management of dates and times to insulate us from the specific mechanism
* Provide consistency for date operations
* Provide consistency for date and time formats
